# Data Types in Python

## Learning Goals
* Explain variables and data types for Python.
* Summarize the use of objects for Python.
* Comprehend key value pairs and their respective types.
* Create a data structure for my Recipe App.

## Data Structure Choice

For this type of data, I will choose a dictionary to store the recipe information because the attributes for a particular recipe are defined by name (labeled). Thus, I can pull or update any needed data using its key value or using the 'get()' function rather than using index on lists and tuples. Furthermore, there are plenty of operations I can perform on this data structure that enables me to create and manipulate the data easily.
