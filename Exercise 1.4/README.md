# File Handling in Python 

I used recipe_input.py to input new recipes into a binary file. I then used recipe_search.py to be able to pull up that binary file and list all ingredients in the recipes in that file. Users can then select an ingredient from the binary file, and it will pull up all recipes that include that ingredient.
